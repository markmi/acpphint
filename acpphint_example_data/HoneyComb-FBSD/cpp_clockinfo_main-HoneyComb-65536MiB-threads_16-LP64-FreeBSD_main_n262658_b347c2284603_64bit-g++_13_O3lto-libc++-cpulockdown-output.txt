Clock tick is not slow relative to execution:
no zero durations observed.

Of 2'000'000 near 'back to back now()' durations:

minimum duration                     : 39 ns
(to be subtracted out from activity durations)

target approx. min actvity duration  : 4'100 ns
(with min duration still included)

target with min duration subtracted  : 4'061 ns

Other information for reference:

small scale duration variability     : 41 ns

largest observed duration            : 125'876 ns
(with min duration still included)
