#
# acpphint's makefile.*'s are very tailored to my use but may be
# used to see how to build the investigative programs and the
# benchmark program and what they in turn require.
#
# Before including makefile.common_part :
# Adjust CXXLIB, CXX, OPT, CPULOCKDOWN_OPT, LDCXX, COMPILER_DESC,
# LIBRARY_DESC, COMPUTER, RAM, THREADS, CPP_DATA_MODEL, OS,
# and SUFFIX as appropriate.
#
# The major targets are: build gather-info
# (Some examples may add other major targets.)
#
# The makefile.*'s are not set up for cross-build use.
#
# The naming used does require (relative to POSIX):
# "allow other characters in target names as extensions"
#

# Note: The "threads_4" is what the hardware has for
# HW threads --or as presented by the likes of HyperV.
# acpphint will also add using_N_threads to file names
# recording benchmark results.
#
# Note: macOS did things like initiate some memory
# compression during gather-info, but did not
# page out to swapsace. Still, such activity has
# fairly long term consequences for measuring the
# the time for a bunch of laps. (There may have
# been more, less obvious, extra-activity at
# times.)
